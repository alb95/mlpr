In this repository you may find Matlab code used in [Bucci, Meini, Poloni].

The three algorithms used for the experiments are 'newton', 'bootstrap_wrong_derivative' and 'continuation_eulernewton'.

In 'tensors' you can load the tensors generated by Gleich and used in https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1465.

Both 'create_tensor' and 'create_unbalanced_tensor' can be used to generate tensor of any size. In the article the set of tensors used has been generated with the second one, since they result sparse and more problematic.

The other functions have been used to obtain the plots.
